# Next.js and Clerk Demo with .NET API Integration

This demo project showcases the integration of Clerk for authentication in a Next.js application. The project demonstrates how to use Clerk's webhooks to synchronize user data with a .NET API backend. The backend API is responsible for maintaining a consistent database, ensuring that any changes in the Clerk user data are reflected in the application's database.

## Key Features:
- **Next.js Frontend**: Utilizes Clerk for seamless user authentication and management.
- **Clerk Webhooks**: Triggers events to keep the .NET API database in sync with Clerk user data.
- **.NET API Backend**: Handles database operations to ensure data consistency and integrity.

## Technologies Used:
- **Next.js**: For building the frontend of the application.
- **Clerk**: Provides user authentication and management features.
- **.NET**: Backend API for handling database synchronization.
- **Webhooks**: For real-time updates and data synchronization between Clerk and the .NET API.
